# Text-Mining
Code from an assignment I completed based on text mining. Documents from the included dataset are pre-processed, features are extracted and then Naive Bayes, SVM (linear and RBF kernels) and Random Forest classifiers are implemented to predict topics of documents. Code is written in R.
